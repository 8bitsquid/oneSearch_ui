for the oneSearch interface.</p>
<p>All modules in this app are named with their immediate parent&#39;s name prepended.
So, all modules at this point are prepended with &quot;oneSearch.<em>&quot;, and modules loaded in &quot;oneSearch.common&quot; are prepended with &quot;common.</em>&quot;, and so on.
This is a lazy attempt to prevent namespace conflicts with other javascripts.</p>
