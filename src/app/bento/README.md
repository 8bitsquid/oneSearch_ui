Bento Box Route
============

This route uses the `common.mediaTypes` module to display results across all registered engines, grouped by media types. Each box represents a media type
defined by an engine's configuration. If an engine does not define a media type, it is considered to be it's own media type. 
See the [media-types README](common/media-type) for details.
